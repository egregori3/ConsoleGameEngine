# Overview

The internet provides a wealth of valuable resources for a student learning object-oriented programming. This projected started as a resource guide with the goal of connecting students to on-line resources: https://github.com/egregori3/C-Plus-Plus_Article                          
                                                                            
Student feedback about the on-line resources indicated a need for better "more interesting" examples. That feedback drove this project. The code for this project was written to demonstrate various aspects of C++ and OOP, not necassarily to demonstrate best programming practices. In some cases, I know I swayed from best practices in order to demonstrate as many C++ and OOP techniques as possible. I note these decisions in the comments. When selecting resources to reference, the goal is quality and variety (exposing the students to as many resources as possible). The ZC in the notes reference chapters in the Zybook textbook.            
                                                                           
The comments in the code reference Zybook chapters using the following notation: ZC7.1 referres to Zybooks chapter 7, section 1

There are 2 "identical" projects: one written using basic C++ (C++98) and the other written using advanced C++ (C++11, C++14).

## IntroCPP demonstrates

 * class/struct
 * Encapsulation
 * Abstraction
 * Polymorphism (virtual functions)
 * Inheritance (base class / derived class)
 * Interface (abstract class)
 * Virtual Functions
 * vectors
 * pointers
 * pass by reference

## AdvCPP (everything in Intro plus)

 * smart pointers
 * List-initialization
