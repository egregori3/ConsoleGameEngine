 *  The internet provides a wealth of valuable resources for a student        *
 *  learning object-oriented programming. This projected started as a resource*
 *  guide with the goal of connecting students to on-line resources:          *
 *  https://github.com/egregori3/C-Plus-Plus_Article                          *
 *                                                                            *
 *  Student feedback about the on-line resources indicated a need for better  *
 *  "more interesting" examples. That feedback drove this project.            *
 *  The code for this project was written to demonstrate various aspects of   *
 *  C++ and OOP, not necassarily to demonstrate best programming practices.   *
 *  In some cases, I know I swayed from best practices in order to demonstrate*
 *  as many C++ and OOP techniques as possible. I note these decisions in the *
 *  comments. When selecting resources to reference, the goal is quality and  *
 *  variety (exposing the students to as many resources as possible).         *
 *                                                                            *
