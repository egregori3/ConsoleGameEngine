 *  The internet provides a wealth of valuable resources for a student        *
 *  learning object-oriented programming. This projected started as a resource*
 *  guide with the goal of connecting students to on-line resources:          *
 *  https://github.com/egregori3/C-Plus-Plus_Article                          *
 *                                                                            *
 *  Student feedback about the on-line resources indicated a need for better  *
 *  "more interesting" examples. That feedback drove this project.            *
 *  The code for this project was written to demonstrate various aspects of   *
 *  C++ and OOP, not necassarily to demonstrate best programming practices.   *
 *  In some cases, I know I swayed from best practices in order to demonstrate*
 *  as many C++ and OOP techniques as possible. I note these decisions in the *
 *  comments. When selecting resources to reference, the goal is quality and  *
 *  variety (exposing the students to as many resources as possible).         *
 *  The ZC in the notes reference chapters in the Zybook textbook.            *
 *                                                                            *
 *  The comments in the code reference Zybook chapters using the following    *
 *  notation: ZC7.1 referres to Zybooks chapter 7, section 1                  *
 *                                                                            *

 *                 understand how the black box works in order to use it.     *

 *  Inheritance:   code reuse (ZC8.1)                                         *
 *  Interface:     the use of inheritance to separate users from              *
 *                 implementations (ZC8.6)                                    *
 *  Virtual Functions:                                                        *
 *  @see https://isocpp.org/wiki/faq/virtual-functions   (ZC8.4)              *
 *  A virtual function allows derived classes to replace the implementation   *
 *  provided by the base class. A pure virtual function is a function that    *
 *  must be overridden in a derived class and need not be defined.            *
 *                                                                            *

 * A struct is a bundle. A struct is several related elements that needed to be

 * number of arguments to a function.
 * Here are some reasons using structure in C++.
 * Use a struct when you need to store elements of different data types under 
 * one data type.
 * C++ structs are a value type rather than being a reference type. Use a struct 
 * if you donâ€™t intend to modify your data after creation.

 * @section USAGE
 *  To create a character for your game, Create a derived class that inherites from this ABC.
