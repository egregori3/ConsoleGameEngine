 *  The internet provides a wealth of valuable resources for a student        *
 *  learning object-oriented programming. This projected started as a resource*
 *  guide with the goal of connecting students to on-line resources:          *
 *  https://github.com/egregori3/C-Plus-Plus_Article                          *
 *                                                                            *
 *  Student feedback about the on-line resources indicated a need for better  *
 *  "more interesting" examples. That feedback drove this project.            *
 *  The code for this project was written to demonstrate various aspects of   *
 *  C++ and OOP, not necassarily to demonstrate best programming practices.   *
 *  In some cases, I know I swayed from best practices in order to demonstrate*
 *  as many C++ and OOP techniques as possible. I note these decisions in the *
 *  comments. When selecting resources to reference, the goal is quality and  *
 *  variety (exposing the students to as many resources as possible).         *
 *  The ZC in the notes reference chapters in the Zybook textbook.            *
 *                                                                            *
 *  The comments in the code reference Zybook chapters using the following    *
 *  notation: ZC7.1 referres to Zybooks chapter 7, section 1                  *
 *                                                                            *

 *  Encapsulation: data hiding, scope management (ZC7.1)                      *
 *  Abstraction:   Once you learn to use the interface, you do not need to    *
 *                 understand how the black box works in order to use it.     *
 *  Polymorphism:  function overloading and virtual functions (ZC8.4)         *
 *  Inheritance:   code reuse (ZC8.1)                                         *
 *  Interface:     the use of inheritance to separate users from              *
 *                 implementations (ZC8.6)                                    *
 *  Virtual Functions:                                                        *
 *  @see https://isocpp.org/wiki/faq/virtual-functions   (ZC8.4)              *
 *  A virtual function allows derived classes to replace the implementation   *
 *  provided by the base class. A pure virtual function is a function that    *
 *  must be overridden in a derived class and need not be defined.            *
 *                                                                            *

 * A struct is a bundle. A struct is several related elements that needed to be

 * number of arguments to a function.
 * Here are some reasons using structure in C++.
 * Use a struct when you need to store elements of different data types under 
 * one data type.
 * C++ structs are a value type rather than being a reference type. Use a struct 
 * if you donâ€™t intend to modify your data after creation.

 * @class character

 *  instantiated from the class is registered with the SimpleGame class.

 * @section DESCRIPTION
 *  get_state()    needs to return the characters current state
 *  update_state() needs to update the characters state based on the world state
 *                 and (if a user controlled character) user_input or

 *
 * @section USAGE
 *  To create a character for your game, create a derived class that inherites from this ABC.
 *  Your derived class must keep track of the characters state (x,y,c) and
 *  based on the world_state, plus either the user interface or an AI decision, update
 *  the state of the character.

 *  https://www.cs.fsu.edu/~myers/c++/notes/references.html
 *  https://www.tutorialspoint.com/cplusplus/cpp_function_call_by_reference.htm
 *  The call by reference method of passing arguments to a function copies the

 *  the reference is used to access the actual argument used in the call. 
 *  This means that changes made to the parameter affect the passed argument.

 *                 with the number of rows and columns in the background
 *  get_state()    needs to return the world state based on the character state
 *  update_state() needs to update the world state based on the character state
 *
 * @section USAGE
 *  To create a world for your game, create a derived class that inherites from this ABC.
 *  A world consists of a background and a set of rules that you define by implementing
 *  the interface functions.
